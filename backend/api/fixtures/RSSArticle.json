In most cases, they scan for vulnerabilities within their code or containers before deploying their cloud workloads into production. However, in runtime \u2014 when actual cyber attacks can occur \u2014 organizations are left completely blind. <strong><u><br/><br/></u></strong>In my discussions with CISOs during the last year I was surprised to hear that, despite having hundreds or even thousands of cloud servers, security teams lack visibility into what code is actually running inside their production environment. These teams believe that what\u2019s running is the software they intentionally deployed during the CI/CD process. However, they aren\u2019t certain.<strong><u><br/><br/></u></strong>Having no visibility in runtime is problematic. If an attacker wants to steal your credentials or exploit a vulnerability \u2014 in any kind of attack vector \u2014 a cyber attack is almost always the result of malicious code or commands running in your servers.<br/><strong><u><br/></u></strong>While pre-runtime security vulnerability checks are effective to some extent, they are not sufficient enough to cope with modern cyber threats, which don\u2019t necessarily rely on a known vulnerability. It\u2019s time for organizations to gain visibility and control over the code that is running in their cloud workloads.
